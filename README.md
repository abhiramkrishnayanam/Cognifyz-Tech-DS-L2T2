# Price Range Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing restaurant price ranges and their associated ratings. The goal is to derive insights such as the most common price range, the average rating for each price range, and the color representing the highest average rating. The analysis is performed using Python, leveraging its data manipulation and analytical capabilities with the Pandas library.

## Objectives
1. **Determine the Most Common Price Range**:
   - Identify which price range is most frequently observed among all the restaurants.

2. **Calculate the Average Rating for Each Price Range**:
   - Compute the mean of aggregate ratings for each price range to assess customer satisfaction levels.

3. **Identify the Color Representing the Highest Average Rating**:
   - Find the color associated with the highest average rating across different price ranges to understand how ratings are visually categorized.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used contains information about restaurants, including:
- **Price Range**: A numerical representation of the cost range for the restaurant.
- **Aggregate Rating**: The average customer rating for the restaurant.
- **Rating Color**: A categorical variable representing the color coding for ratings (e.g., Dark Green, Green, etc.).

## Key Steps
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - Imported the dataset and explored its structure, ensuring all relevant columns were available.

2. **Most Common Price Range**:
   - Analyzed the frequency of each price range to determine the most common one.

3. **Average Rating Calculation**:
   - Grouped the data by price range and calculated the average aggregate rating for each group.

4. **Color for Highest Average Rating**:
   - Identified the row with the highest average rating and extracted the corresponding rating color.

## Results
1. **Most Common Price Range**:
   - The price range with the highest frequency was identified (e.g., Range 3).

2. **Average Ratings**:
   - Average ratings were computed for each price range, highlighting variations in customer satisfaction.

3. **Color Representation**:
   - The color corresponding to the highest average rating was identified (e.g., "Dark Green"), indicating excellent performance in that price range.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**:
  - Core programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**:
  - Used for data manipulation and aggregation.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into customer preferences and satisfaction levels based on price ranges. It highlights the price range most preferred by customers and how ratings are distributed across different ranges. These insights can aid restaurant businesses in better understanding market trends and customer satisfaction.
